I think that this activity was a bit interesting. My conclusion was that whenever the word "gay" is used there is often a difference between user input data and Perspective API. I came to this conclusion because the min and max of the difference of the two different user input data - Perspective API both have the word Gay in them. 

I then got curious and then found that all words that had gay in them had either a 0 difference or a very large difference between them. 

I thought that this was interesting because gay can have a different context depending on the intent, so I wondered if Perspective API is biased because of this.
