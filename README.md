I think that this activity was a bit interesting. My conclusion was that whenever the word "gay" is used there is often a difference between user input data and Perspective API. I came to this conclusion because the min and max of the difference of the two different user input data - Perspective API both have the word Gay in them. 

I found this incredibly interesting so I decided to hypothesis that maybe Perspective API has issues with dealing with comments that have "gay" in them, so I decided to test it. I got the average of all the difference in scores between Perspective API and user input data. 

I then ran a statistical test with The Mean is .230448 and SD is .2791 so the z-score is .33931 and so the p-value is .367188. Hower since the p-value is more than 5, we can not reject that this is because of chance, so my hypothesis wasn't proved.
